# Description

A deep dive into the abstruse ocean of human hand biometrics. 
The project sets to unravel the buried secrets concealed behind the reliquies of this profound sea.

<b>MIMIC aims to synthetize human-like mouse movements</b>, in their minute detail.
Negligible was not a word we ever considered throughout our journey, we aspire to achieve perfection and consistency at any generation.

# Human-Behaviour

The project is built on human biometric theory, thus almost impossible to be recognized by any form of antibots nor human.
In the image below, one is a real human generated movement, the other is a synthesized trajectory from MIMIC.
More images are avaible <a href="https://github.com/MIMIC-LOGICS/Mouse-Synthesizer/tree/main/images">here</a>.

# Flexibility

Highly customizable in every aspect.

- Customizable number of stops at each generation
  - Customizable <b>starting</b> and <b>ending position</b> of each stop</li>
  - Customizable <b>time</b> occurence of each stop  </li>
  - Customizable bounding box between stops (<i>soon</i>)
- Customizable <b>Noise</b>
- Customizable Sampling Frequency of the movement
- Customizable Screen dimension


# Consistency

MIMIC is able to generate valid synthesized trajectory consistently, without being flagged by any type of algorithm.

Many thanks to <b>M-NK-Y</b> who has always been of great support and inspired me to make of this project what it is now.
